//  The purpose of this application is to help a company called Bill's Burgers manage the process of selling their hamburger.
//
//  For the base Hamburger class, there are four variables to represent the four basic ingredients of the hamburger, (name, meat, price, breadRollType)
//
//  There are 4 seperate variables that are additional add-ons to the hamburger.
//
//  Four methods are needed for adding the 4 different add-ons. Each method takes in a 'name' and a 'price'.
//  Another method calculates the hamburger's price including any add-ons.
//
//
//  A second class DeluxeBurger, without any member variables, is needed for another type of burger. This class has a constructor
//  without any parameters. The DeluxeBurger comes with chips and a drink. However, no additional add-ons can be added.class
//
//  A third class HealthyBurger allows for 2 additional healthy add-ons.
